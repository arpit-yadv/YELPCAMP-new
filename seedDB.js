		description: `Some of our top treks are favourites because of the mountain views they offer. Think of Chaukhambha from Deoriatal Chandrashila or Bandarpoonch from Dayara Bugyal. It is difficult to find such magnified views of big mountains like these. However, Brahmatal is a trek that takes the cake. It has a view that beats all of these!

        Here is why. Right on your second day, you climb out of beautiful rhododendron and oak forest to see a white wall of the Trishul massif. And these views only come closer as you traverse the ridge towards Jhandi Top.
        
        At Jhandi top, you are almost at the center of the mountain views. To your right rises the massive Mt Trishul and to your left stands Mt Nanda Ghunti. You even see the Ronti Saddle, the ridge that connects Mt Trishul and Mt Nanda Ghunti!

        That is not all. At the highest point of Brahmatal trek, Brahmatal Top,  a new set of mountains open themselves up before you. You see Mt Neelkanth, Mt Hathi Ghoda… while Trishul and Nanda Ghunti are to your right. Always there.
        
        Mt Trishul and Mt Nanda Ghunti, are your companions throughout the trek. Even the highest point of this trek is approached from the side that is exposed to Mt Trishul and Mt Nanda Ghunti.  This trek deserves to be talked about among treks with the best mountain views.
        
        Brahmatal-Indiahikes
        Brahmatal has a unique setting, where you get a bird’s eye view of everything around you. That’s not possible on any other trek. Picture by Geet Tryambake
        It is one of the few treks accessible in peak winter months of January and February
        To top it all, Brahmatal has lovely forests, two lakes to look forward to and a meadow to traverse through. The entire trail is under snow in peak winter. All of these experiences are to be earned though. The trek is a moderate one. We would advise you to prepare well.`,

		description: `A Challenging Summit Climb High on Adventure
        If you are looking for a power packed thrilling summit climb, climbing all the way till 15,069 ft, then Pangarchulla Peak trek offers it in spades.
        
        To begin with, Pangarchulla is a 5-day trek (7 days when you include the travel days from Rishikesh). The trek starts from Dhak, a small village near Joshimath in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand. It is situated in the Nanda Devi National Park. 
        
        Pangarchulla is marked as a difficult trek in the Himalayas. There are three things about the trek that will stay with you.
        
        An adventure filled summit climb
        This trek is known for its summit climb. For anyone who has done this trek, that will be the first thing to recall about their trek. The summit day is for one very long. You climb over lots of boulders covered over snow, feeling your feet every step of the way.

        As you climb high, you also traverse lots of tricky, steep and exposed sections which adds to the thrill and adventure. You also climb till 15,069 ft, almost 4,000 ft up and down on the summit day. All of this makes this trek a very exciting and adventure filled one.
        
        Grand views of the Greater Himalayan Range
        While the summit climb in itself leaves you with a strong adrenaline rush, what adds to this experience is the mountain views you get from the top. All along the trek you are accompanied along with grand views of a big part of the Greater Himalayan Range. And at the summit, you are surrounded by them and they all stand so close to you.

        This feeling is unparalleled and very hard to find in any other treks in the Himalayas. You are surrounded by a 360 degree view of Hathi Parbat, Mana Mandir, Kamet, Nanda Devi, Dronagiri, Chaukhamba, Ghori Parbat and many more peaks that are steeped in mythology and mountaineering stories.
        
        Camping at Khullara
        Very few campsites in the Himalayas can compare to Khullara. Khullara is a big open ground surrounded by dense beautiful forests and the grand mountain views. The forests for one are a highlight themselves, providing the setting of a forest in a fairy tale.

        And when you trek in March and April, they are filled with blooming Rhododendrons, providing colors to the already beautiful forest. Being in Khullara will definitely transport you to a different world altogether. And what more, you get to spend two days in this campsite (including the acclimatization day).  
        
        Even if you leave these aspects out, the Pangarchulla Peak is a superb trek. The beautiful sights and challenges of the trek make it a trek worth doing.`,

		description: `One Of The Finest Summit Climbs For Beginners
        Kedarkantha (not to be confused with the popular Temple Kedarnath) is a 6-day long trek in Govind Pashu Vihar National Park in Uttarakhand (6 when including the travel days from Dehradun to the base camp and back). Kedarkantha is easily one of the most popular treks in India — popular amongst seasoned trekkers and beginners alike.
        
        There are many reasons why it is a very popular trek to do in the Indian Himalayas.  The most important of them is this — the summit climb.
        
        The summit climb of Kedarkantha is a very rewarding one.  Right from the base camp of the trek, the summit looms large.  As you start your trek in the early hours of the morning and steadily climb up the steep slope, the world opens up around you.
        
        The climb is not easy.  The entire stretch is steadily steep.  As you get closer to the summit, it gets tricky as well.  But the big mountains of the upper Himalayas keep you company until you finally reach the summit.
        
        As you stretch yourself and take in the views of the Himalayas from the summit, you feel a strong sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. This is an unparalleled feeling.
        
        Very few treks offer the same adventure, making it popular among beginners for its finest summit climb.
        
        Outside the summit, the trek is also unique for its beautiful clearings.  Very rarely you will find stunning clearings on a trek that makes way for some rest spots and beautiful campsites.  This trek is filled with clearings in all the different routes.  What more, the clearings are just at the right locations, giving you beautiful vantage points to appreciate the trek and its views.
        
        The third biggest reason this trek is unique is its beautiful forests.  All three routes have beautiful diverse forests that will totally immerse you in.  If you are not careful, you will get lost in them (in a good way).`,

		location: "Base Camp-Raithal,Uttrakhand",
		description: `Dayara Bugyal is one of the prettiest meadow treks in our country. At the Dayara meadows, the rolling carpet of grass spreads out far and wide, farther than the eye can see. In winter this carpet of grass turns snow white and stretches out far and wide. Add to this the big mountains that pop out up close – Mt Bandarpoonch, Mt Black Peak, Mt Jaonli, Mt Shrikanth, Mt Draupadi Ka Danda and many more. This grand combination of a rolling white carpet and big mountains is very rare and one of THE reasons why every mountain enthusiast must trek to Dayara Bugyal in winter.

        If you are a beginner, the trek gives you even more reasons to go there. Along with the fantastic meadows, you get a perfect well-rounded Himalyan trek experience. Its lovely forests, picturesque campsites, innumerable high points and ancient villages make it a complete Himalayan trek for new trekkers.
        
        Dayara Bugyal has well laid trekking trails  and evenly paced trekking days. This makes it an “easy trek” addressing one of the biggest concerns of beginners – the difficulty of a trek.`,

		description: `Trekkers think when it comes to great treks you can’t beat treks like Rupin Pass or Buran Ghati. And when we talk about Har Ki Dun with Ruinsara, they think it is a poor cousin. That’s making a big mistake.

        The Har Ki Dun trek with Ruinsara is one of the best complete treks that we have seen.
        
        It has terrific ancient culture, mountain views, forests, grasslands, meadows, rivers, streams and even an alpine lake. This trail is not difficult on the legs which makes it just the right adventure especially when compared to other summer treks.
        
        With Ruinsara added on Har Ki Dun, a good trek becomes great. One of the most complete treks that you will possibly do. 
        
        “It’s like doing a whole new trek by just adding two days”, says Arjun Majumdar, our founder.
        
        The Ruinsara addition throws up a lot of new surprises. You’ll notice it immediately as you get into the untouched forests after Boslo. The biodiversity of the forest is deep; birds are everywhere.
        
        On the other hand, the trail from Rainbasera to Ruinsara takes you into the heart of a narrow valley, where suddenly you see the big lake of Ruinsara. It is an alpine lake fed by snow patches with green, grassy shores.
        
        It is stunning to just sit on the banks of the lake, in the solitude of snowy mountain peaks.
        
        On the return, Devsu thatch has to be the best kept secret of the trek. No one knew that such exquisite clearings could exist right in the middle of a thick forest — that too in such multitude of layers.
        
        If we are fascinated by the grasslands and clearings of Kashmir, Devsu thatch is perhaps even better than some of them! Devsu is not small either. To explore Devsu fully will take a couple of hours at least.
        
        Before we begin, here are some quick facts about Har Ki Dun – Ruinsara Tal trek 
        
        – The Har Ki Dun – Ruinsara Tal is a 70 km trek hiked over a period of 7 days (+2 days to and from the base camp – Sankri) in the Himalayas. 
        
        – The trail located in Uttarakhand takes you to some of the most pristine parts of Govind Pashu Vihar National Park and Sanctuary.
        
        – The base camp of the trek, Sankri, is a 10 hour journey from Dehradun. Sankri is also the base camp for other treks like Kedarkantha, Phulara Ridge, and Bali Pass
        
        – If you’re a beginner to a Himalayan trek, Har Ki Dun – Ruinsara Tal is a good choice. It fits the bill for people wanting to trek solo too.
        
        Having said that, expect to trek 10 km everyday. Therefore prepare well. 
        
        This trek page will help you do that. 
        
        It has day by day itinerary, route description, maps, packing lists and more. 
        
        In short everything you need to know about planning and preparing for Har Ki Dun – Ruinsara Tal trek can be found here.`,

//     The surprises begin right from your first day of trekking. When, around 20 minutes into the trail,  you see the Rupin River make an appearance, fanning out into a wide bed below you. And it doesn’t stop here.
//     From here, the trail takes you through hanging villages and then quite suddenly, it plunges into a deep pine forest!  That’s not all. The trail then meanders through glacial meadows, snow bridges, glacial valleys, snow fields and hundreds of waterfalls!
//     The only constant in this trail that keeps blindsiding you with surprises is the Rupin river. The blue waters of the Rupin runs along the trail as if to complement the scenery. Sometimes rushing, at times gliding by.

//     That being said, this is a moderate-difficult trek. You cover almost 10 km every day and the terrain is quite tricky. The climb to Rati Pheri from Upper waterfall and the steep ascent to Rupin Pass through the gully at 15,380 ft  require very good lung power. Prepare well!`,
